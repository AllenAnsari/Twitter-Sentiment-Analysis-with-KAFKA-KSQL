# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-with-KAFKA-KSQL

Real time data processing has become so crucial in today’s analytical world due to the need to make operational adjustments in hours, even minutes now, not months or years in the past for business entities and government alike. Twitter, one of the most popular social media platforms in today’s world, provides large amount of data daily covering a variety of hot topics through tweets. To be able to harness the vast amount of information hidden within those live tweets would be of great interest to the data science community. To carry out the live data streaming processing, a system having the ability to continuously “listen” to new data input is needed. Herein, we demonstrated that by implementing a pipeline composed of Apache **Kafka** and **KSQL**, combined with machine learning techniques, we were able to automatically filter, aggregate, and analyze the streaming data.
